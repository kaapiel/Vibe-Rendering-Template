<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>2. Software License; Membership.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1 Software License. This Section 2.1 applies to Customers who have purchased a license to
the Software but have not purchased a membership-based license or service such as the Creative
Cloud membership (as described in Section 2.2).</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.1 License Grant. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance with this agreement and payment
of the applicable license fees, Adobe grants Customer a non-exclusive and limited license
to install and use the Software: (a) in the Territory, (b) during the term of such license
(“License Term”), (c) within the scope of the License Type and on the Permitted Number of
Customer’s Compatible Computers as specified in the Documentation, and (d) in a manner consistent
with the terms of this agreement and applicable Documentation. Unless otherwise defined in
this agreement, in the applicable Documentation, or at the time of purchase, License Term
shall be perpetual. Upon the expiration or termination of the License Term, some or all of
the Software may cease to operate without prior notice. Upon expiration or termination of
the License Term, Customer may not use the Software unless Customer has renewed the license.
The license granted herein is supplemented by specific provisions in Section 16 as related
to the use of certain applicable products and components that may be included in the Software
such as font software, Acrobat, After Effects, Adobe Presenter, Contribute, Flash Player,
Flash Builder, Digital Publishing Suite, and Adobe Runtimes.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.2 License Types.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.2.1 Non-Serialized Software. The Software, or portions of the Software, that are provided
without a serial number during the License Term may only be installed and used on any number
of Compatible Computers as part of an organizational deployment plan during the License Term
for demonstration, evaluation, and training purposes only, and only if any Output Files or
other materials produced through such use are used only for internal, non-commercial, and
non-production purposes. THE NON-SERIALIZED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS-IS”. ACCESS TO AND USE
OF ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED WITH SUCH NON-SERIALIZED SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT CUSTOMER’S OWN
RISK.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.2.2 Evaluation Software. The Software, or portions of the Software, that are provided
with a serial number designated for “evaluation purposes” or other similar designation (such
as Software or a serial number supplied as “EVAL” under a separate agreement) (“Evaluation
Software”) may only be installed and used on Permitted Number of Compatible Computers during
the License Term for demonstration, evaluation, and training purposes only, and only if any
Output Files or other materials produced through such use are used only for internal, non-commercial,
and non-production purposes. THE EVALUATION SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”. ACCESS TO AND USE
OF ANY OUTPUT FILES CREATED WITH SUCH EVALUATION SOFTWARE IS ENTIRELY AT CUSTOMER’S OWN RISK.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.2.3 Subscription Edition. For the Software available on a subscription-basis (“Subscription
Edition”), Customer may install and use the Subscription Edition only on the Permitted Number
of Compatible Computer during the License Term. Subject to the Permitted Number of Computers
for the Subscription Edition, Adobe may allow Customer to install and use the most recent
prior version of the Subscription Edition and the current version of the Subscription Edition
on the same Computer during the License Term. Customer agrees that Adobe may change the type
of Software (such as specific components, versions, platforms, languages, etc.) included in
the Subscription Edition at any time and shall not be liable to Customer whatsoever for such
change. Ongoing access to a Subscription Edition requires: (a) a recurring Internet connection
to activate, renew, and validate the license, (b) Adobe or its authorized reseller’s receipt
of recurring subscription payments, and (c) Customer’s agreement to subscription terms and
other additional terms and conditions that are available at <a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_ae">
http://www.adobe.com/go/paymentterms_ae</a> or at the time of purchase. If Adobe does not receive
the recurring subscription payment or cannot validate the license periodically, then the Software
may become inactive without additional notice until Adobe receives the payment or validates
the license.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.3 <b>Portable or Home Computer Use. Subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 2.1.4,
the primary user of the Computer on which the Software is installed under Section 2.1 (“Primary
User”) may install a second copy of the Software for his or her exclusive use on either a
portable Computer or a Computer located at his or her home, provided that the Software on
the portable or home Computer is not used at the same time as the Software on the primary
Computer.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.4 Restrictions on Secondary Use by Volume Licensees. If the Software was obtained under
an Adobe volume license program or agreement (such as Adobe Volume Licensing) by any licensee
other than an educational volume licensee, then the second copy of the Software made under
Section 2.1.3 must be used solely for the benefit and business of that volume licensee.
</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.5 Dual Boot Platform. The Software is licensed for use on a specific operating system
platform. Customer must purchase a separate license for use of the Software on each operating
system platform. By way of example, if Customer desires to install the Software on both the
Mac OS and Windows operating system platforms on a device that runs both of those platforms
(i.e., a dual boot machine), then Customer must first obtain two separate licenses for the
Software. This is true even if two versions of the Software, each designed for a different
operating system platform, are delivered to Customer on the same media.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.6 Distribution from a Server. As permitted by the Documentation, Customer may copy an
image of the Software onto a Computer file server within Customer’s Internal Network (“Server”)
for the purpose of downloading and installing the Software onto Computers within the same
Internal Network for use only as permitted by this Section 2.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.7 Server Use.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.7.1 Except as otherwise permitted in the Documentation and subject to license restrictions
stated in this agreement, Customer shall not install the Software on a Server. If permitted
in such Documentation, then Customer may install the Software on a Server for the purpose
of allowing an individual from a Computer within the same Internal Network (“Network User”)
to access and use the Software. If expressly permitted by Adobe, “Internal Network” may include
web hosting services with dedicated physical server space and restricted access to only Customer.
The Network User who has access to or may use such Software on the Server is referred to as
“Server Software User”. Neither the total number of Server Software Users (not the concurrent
number of users) nor the total number of Computers capable of accessing the Software installed
on the Server may exceed the Permitted Number. By way of example, if Customer has purchased
10 Software licenses (Permitted Number is 10) and Customer elects to install the Software
on a Server, then Customer can only allow up to 10 Server Software Users access to the Software
(even though Customer may have more than 10 Network Users or fewer than 10 concurrent users
of the Software).</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.1.7.2 For clarification and without limitation, the foregoing does not permit Customer to
install or access (either directly or through commands, data, or instructions) the Software:
(a) from or to a Computer not part of Customer’s Internal Network; (b) for enabling web hosted
workgroups or web hosted services available to the public; (c) by any individual or entity
to use, download, copy, or otherwise benefit from the functionality of the Software unless
licensed to do so by Adobe; (d) as a component of a system, workflow or service accessible
by more than the Permitted Number of users; or (e) for operations not initiated by an individual
user (e.g., automated server processing).</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.2 Membership. This Section 2.2 applies to Customers who have purchased a membership-based
license or service such as the Creative Cloud membership (collectively, “Membership”).</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.2.1 Adobe Online Services Related to the Membership. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance
with this agreement and payment of the applicable membership fees, if any, Adobe grants Customer
a non-exclusive, Territory-wide, and limited right to access and use the Software and related
Adobe Online Service (as further described in Section 16.4.1) as part of the Membership, subject
to the terms stated in this agreement and the Additional Terms of Use (as the term is defined
in Section 14.1.3 below).</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.2.2 Software License Related to the Membership. Subject to Customer’s continuous compliance
with this agreement and payment of the applicable membership fees, if any, Adobe grants Customer
a non-exclusive and limited license to install and use the Software: (a) in the Territory,
(b) during the period that the Membership is current and active (“Membership Term”), and (c)
in a manner consistent with the terms of this agreement and applicable Documentation. Upon
the expiration or termination of the Membership Term, (x) some or all of the Software may
cease to operate without prior notice and (y) Customer may not use the Software unless Customer
has renewed the membership. All terms related to the specific Software as stated in this agreement
shall remain effective and continue to apply to Customer and its use of such Software.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.2.3 Restrictions. Customer agrees to the following additional terms and restrictions related
to the Membership: (a) Adobe may change the type of Software (such as specific products, components,
versions, platforms, languages, etc.) included in the Membership at any time and shall not
be liable to Customer whatsoever for such change; (b) Customer may be required to connect
to the Internet and log in at any time during the Membership Term; (c) Software may automatically
connect to the Internet to verify Customer’s Membership without notice at any time; and (d)
Customer may not enable or allow others to use the Software as Customer.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.3 Content Files. Unless stated otherwise in the “Read-Me” files, Documentation, or other
license(s) associated with the Content Files, Customer may use, display, modify, reproduce,
and distribute any of the Content Files. However, Customer may not distribute the Content
Files on a stand-alone basis (i.e., in circumstances in which the Content Files constitute
the primary value of the product being distributed), and Customer may not claim any trademark
rights in the Content Files or derivative works thereof. Nothing stated herein shall affect
the ownership of the Software as stated in Section 3.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.4 Sample Application Code. Customer may modify the source code form of those portions of
the Software programs that are expressly identified as sample code, sample application code,
code snippets, ActionScript class files, or sample components (each, “Sample Application Code”)
in the accompanying Documentation solely for the purposes of designing, developing, and testing
websites and applications developed using Adobe software programs; provided, however, Customer
is permitted to copy and distribute the Sample Application Code (modified or unmodified) only
if all of the following conditions are met: (a) Customer distributes only the compiled object
code versions of the Sample Application Code with its application; (b) Customer does not include
the Sample Application Code in any product or application designed for website development;
and (c) Customer does not use the Adobe name, logos, icons, or other Adobe trademarks to market
its application. Customer agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Adobe from and against
any loss, damage, claims, or lawsuits, including attorney’s fees, that arise or result from
the use or distribution of its application.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.5 Programming Languages. The Software may include portions of the ExtendScript SDK and Pixel
Bender SDK. Subject to the restrictions contained in this Section 2, Adobe grants to Customer
a nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license to use the items in the ExtendScript
SDK and Pixel Bender SDK only for the purpose of internal development of application programs
designed to function with Adobe products. Except as expressly provided in this Section 2.5,
no portions of the ExtendScript SDK or the Pixel Bender SDK may be modified or distributed.
Customer agrees to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend Adobe from and against any loss, damage,
claims, or lawsuits, including attorney’s fees, that arise or result from such distribution.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
2.6 Documentation Copies. Customer may make no more than a reasonable number of copies of
the Documentation for Customer’s own internal use in connection with use of the Software.</p>
<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>3. Intellectual Property Ownership.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
The Software and any authorized copies that Customer makes are the intellectual property of
and are owned by Adobe Systems Incorporated and its suppliers. The structure, organization,
and source code of the Software are the valuable trade secrets and confidential information
of Adobe Systems Incorporated and its suppliers. The Software is protected by law, including
but not limited to the copyright laws of the United States and other countries, and by international
treaty provisions. Except as expressly stated herein, this agreement does not grant Customer
any intellectual property rights in the Software. All rights not expressly granted are reserved
by Adobe and its suppliers.</p>
<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>4. Restrictions and Requirements.</b></p>
<br>

code of the Software.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
4.5 No Unbundling. The Software may include various applications and components, may allow
access to different Adobe Online Services, may support multiple platforms and languages, and
may be provided to Customer on multiple media or in multiple copies. Nonetheless, the Software
is designed and provided to Customer as a single product to be used as a single product on
Computers as permitted herein. Customer is not required to install all component parts of
the Software, but Customer may not unbundle the component parts of the Software for use on
different Computers.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
4.6 No Transfer.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
4.6.1 CUSTOMER WILL NOT RENT, LEASE, SELL, SUBLICENSE, ASSIGN, OR TRANSFER ITS RIGHTS IN THE
SOFTWARE (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, SOFTWARE OBTAINED THROUGH A WEB DOWNLOAD), OR AUTHORIZE
ANY PORTION OF THE SOFTWARE TO BE COPIED ONTO ANOTHER INDIVIDUAL OR LEGAL ENTITY’S COMPUTER
EXCEPT AS MAY BE EXPRESSLY PERMITTED HEREIN.
</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">

Software (as defined in Section 16.2), Evaluation Software, not-for-resale copies of the Software,
or Software obtained through an Adobe volume license program and further subject to Section

number(s), the Software and all other software or hardware bundled, packaged, or pre-installed
with the Software, including all copies, Updates, and Prior Versions (as defined in Section
5, below), and (iii) all copies of font software to such individual or entity; (b) Customer
retains no Updates, Prior Versions, or copies, including backups and copies stored on a Computer;
and (c) the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this agreement and any other

information on transferring volume licensed software is available at <a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_ae">
http://www.adobe.com/go/volumepolicies_ae</a>.
</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
4.6.3 If the Software requires recurring activation or registration and Adobe grants Customer’s
request to be exempted from the requirement of such recurring activation or registration,
then in addition to the restrictions set forth in the Activation Terms (as defined in Section
14.3), then the right to permanently transfer as stated in Section 4.6.2 shall terminate immediately
upon the grant of such request.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
4.6.4 Notwithstanding Section 4.6.2 above, Customer may only transfer all its rights to use

unless otherwise permitted by applicable laws.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">

not use Adobe Runtimes on any non-PC device or with any embedded or device version of any
operating system. For the avoidance of doubt, and by example only, Customer may not use Adobe

media center (other than with Windows XP Media Center Edition and its successors), electronic
billboard or other digital signage, Internet appliance or other Internet-connected device,
PDA, medical device, ATM, telematic device, gaming machine, home automation system, kiosk,

anything stated to the contrary, for Customer who purchases a license with Permitted Number
greater than 1 (or more than 1 copy of the Software), Customer must install or deploy the

technological measures intended to control access to the Software or (b) develop or distribute

<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>5. Updates.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
If the Software is an Update to a prior version of Adobe software (the “Prior Version”), then
Customer’s use of this Update is conditional upon its retention of the Prior Version. Therefore,
if Customer validly transfers this Update pursuant to Section 4.6, the Customer must transfer
the Prior Version along with it. If Customer wishes to use this Update in addition to the
Prior Version, then Customer may only do so on the same Computer on which it has installed
and is using the Prior Version. Any obligations that Adobe may have to support Prior Versions
during the License Term may end upon the availability of this Update. No other use of the
Update is permitted. Additional Updates may be licensed to Customer by Adobe with additional
or different terms.</p>
<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>6. Limited Warranty.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
Except as otherwise stated in a separate agreement between Adobe and a Software licensee,
Adobe warrants to the individual or entity who first purchases a license for the Software
that the Software will perform substantially in accordance with the corresponding user manual
for the Software for the shorter period of (a) the ninety (90) day period or (b) License Term
following delivery of the Software (“Warranty Period”) when used on the Compatible Computer.
Non-substantial variation of performance from the user manual does not establish a warranty
right. This limited warranty does not apply to the following, which are made available AS-IS
and without warranty from Adobe: (i) patches; (ii) font software; (iii) Pre-release Software,
trial, starter, evaluation, product sampler, Evaluation Software, and not-for-resale copies
of the Software; (iv) websites, Adobe Online Services; and Third Party Online Services; (v)
Certified Document Services (see Section 16); and (vi) any software made available by Adobe
for free via web download from an Adobe website. All warranty claims must be made, along with
proof of purchase, to the Adobe Customer Support Department within such Warranty Period. Additional
information on warranty claims is available at <a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/support_ae">
http://www.adobe.com/go/support_ae</a>. The entire liability of Adobe and its affiliates related
to such warranty claim and Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy under any warranty will be
limited to either, at Adobe’s option, support of the Software based on the warranty claim,
replacement of the Software, or, if support or replacement is not practicable at Adobe’s determination,
refund of the license fee Adobe received for the Software (if any). Customer shall only request
refunds from the vendor who sold Customer the Software. THE LIMITED WARRANTY SET FORTH IN
THIS SECTION GIVES CUSTOMER SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS UNDER
LAW WHICH MAY VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT CUSTOMER’S
WARRANTY RIGHTS TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. Please see Section 16 for jurisdiction-specific
provisions or contact the Adobe Customer Support Department.</p>
<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>7. Disclaimer.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
THE LIMITED WARRANTY IN SECTION 6 AND ANY STATUTORY WARRANTY AND REMEDY THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED
OR LIMITED UNDER LAW ARE THE ONLY WARRANTIES AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES APPLICABLE TO THE SOFTWARE.
OTHER THAN THOSE OFFERED AND STATUTORY WARRANTIES AND REMEDIES, ADOBE, ITS AFFILIATES, SUPPLIERS,

AUTHORITY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED AS-IS AND WITH ALL FAULTS. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY MAY
NOT BE VALID IN SOME JURISDICTIONS. CUSTOMER MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY RIGHTS UNDER LAW
WHICH MAY NOT BE WAIVED OR DISCLAIMED. ADOBE DOES NOT SEEK TO LIMIT CUSTOMER’S WARRANTY RIGHTS
TO ANY EXTENT NOT PERMITTED BY LAW. The provisions of Sections 7 and Section 8 will survive
the termination of this agreement, howsoever caused, but this will not imply or create any
continued right to use the Software after termination of this agreement.</p>

<p class="c5">
EXCEPT FOR THE EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OFFERED BY ADOBE ABOVE AND ANY REMEDIES THAT CANNOT BE EXCLUDED

EVENT OF A FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL BREACH OR A BREACH OF THE FUNDAMENTAL OR MATERIAL TERMS
OF THIS AGREEMENT. Nothing contained in this agreement limits Adobe’s liability to Customer
in the event of death or personal injury resulting from Adobe’s negligence or for the tort
of deceit (fraud). Adobe is acting on behalf of its affiliates, suppliers, and Certificate
Authorities for the purpose of disclaiming, excluding and limiting obligations, warranties,
and liability, but in no other respects and for no other purpose.</p>

the copyright laws of the United States.</p>
<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>13. Compliance with Licenses.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
If Customer is a business, company, or organization, Customer agrees that, in addition to
any license compliance checking performed by the Software, Adobe or its authorized representative
have the right, no more than once every twelve (12) months, upon seven (7) business days’
prior notice to Customer, to inspect Customer’s records, systems, and facilities to verify
that its installation and use of any and all Adobe software or service is in conformity with
its valid licenses from Adobe. For example, Adobe has the right to those of Customer’s records
useful to determine whether installations of the Software have been serialized, and Customer
shall provide such records to Adobe promptly upon request by Adobe. Additionally, Customer
shall provide Adobe with all records and information requested by Adobe in order to verify
that its installation and use of any and all Adobe software is in conformity with its valid
licenses from Adobe within thirty (30) days of Adobe’s request. Additional information on
serialization is available at <a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_ae">
http://www.adobe.com/go/elicensing_ae</a>. If the verification discloses a shortfall in licenses
for the Software or Membership, Customer shall immediately acquire any necessary licenses,
memberships, and any applicable back maintenance and support.</p>
<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>14. Internet Connectivity and Privacy.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.1 Automatic Connections to the Internet. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without
notice, to automatically connect to the Internet and to communicate with an Adobe website
or Adobe domain for purposes such as validating Software license and providing Customer with
additional information, features, or functionality. The Adobe Online Privacy Policy, available
at <a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_ae">http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_ae</a>
(“Privacy Policy”), governs such connection and communication. Specifically:
</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.1.1 Pursuant to the Privacy Policy, Adobe may (a) track website visits through the use
of cookies, web beacons, and similar devices and (b) collect and transmit Customer information.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.1.2 As permitted by applicable law or as consented to by Customer, Adobe may (a) send Customer
transactional messages to facilitate the Adobe Online Service or the activation or registration
of the Software or Adobe Online Service or (b) deliver in-product marketing to provide information
about the Software and other Adobe products and Services using information including, but
not limited to, platform version, version of the Software, license status, and language.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.2 Updating. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without additional notice, to automatically
connect to the Internet (intermittently or on a regular basis) to (a) check for Updates that
are available for download to and installation on the Computer and (b) notify Adobe of the
results of installation attempts.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.3 Activation. The Software may require Customer to (a) obtain an Adobe ID, (b) activate
or reactivate the Software, including activation of certain components or features, (c) register
the software, or (d) validate the Membership. Such requirement may cause Customer’s Computer
to connect to the Internet without notice on install, on launch, and on a regular basis thereafter.
Once connected, the Software will collect and transmit information to Adobe as further described
at <a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ae">http://www.adobe.com/go/activation_ae</a>
(“Activation Terms”). Software or Customer may also receive information from Adobe related
to Customer’s license, subscription, or Membership. Adobe may use such information to detect
or prevent fraudulent or unauthorized use not in accordance with a valid license, subscription,
or Membership. Failure to activate or register the Software, validate the subscription or
Membership, or a determination by Adobe of fraudulent or unauthorized use of the Software
may result in reduced functionality, inoperability of the Software, or a termination or suspension
of the subscription or Membership.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.4 Deactivation. Customer may deactivate and uninstall the Software from its Computer in
order to install and activate the Software on another Computer in accordance with this agreement

<br>
<p class="c5">
14.5 Use of Online Services. The Software may cause Customer’s Computer, without additional
notice and on an intermittent or regular basis, to automatically connect to the Internet to
facilitate Customer’s access to content and services that are provided by Adobe or third parties
as further described in Section 16.4 (Online Services). In addition, the Software may, without
additional notice, automatically connect to the Internet to update downloadable materials
from these online services so as to provide immediate availability of these services even
when Customer is offline. If Customer accesses an Adobe Online Service (as defined in Section
16.4 below), then additional information such as Customer’s Adobe ID, user name, and password
may be transmitted to and stored by Adobe pursuant to the Privacy Policy.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.6 Digital Certificates. The Software uses digital certificates (as described in Section
16.5) to help Customer identify downloaded files (e.g., applications and content) and the
publishers of those files. For example, Adobe AIR uses digital certificates to help Customer
identify the publisher of Adobe AIR applications. The Adobe Acrobat family of products also
uses digital certificates to sign and validate signatures within Portable Document Format
(“PDF”) documents and to validate certified PDF documents. Customer’s Computer may connect
to the Internet at the time of validation of a digital certificate.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
14.7 Settings Manager. The Software may include Flash Player. Flash Player may save certain
user settings by storing them on Customer’s Computer as a local shared object. They are associated
with the instance of Flash Player on the Computer, allowing Customer to customize runtime
features. The Flash Player Settings Manager permits Customer to modify such settings, including
the ability to limit third parties from storing local shared objects or grant third-party
content the right to access the computer’s microphone and camera. Additional information on
how to configure settings in its version of Flash Player, including information on how to
disable local shared objects using the Flash Player Settings Manager, is available at <a target="ADB-ESG"

<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>15. Peer-to-Peer Communications.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
The Software may use Customer’s connection to a local area network, without additional notice,
to automatically connect to other Adobe software and, in doing so, may indicate on the local
area network that it is available for communication with other Adobe software. These connections
may transmit the IP Address of Customer’s connection to the local network.</p>
<br>
<p class="c4">
<b>16. Specific Provisions and Exceptions.</b></p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
This section sets forth specific provisions related to certain products and components of
the Software as well as limited exceptions to the above terms and conditions. To the extent
that any provision in this section is in conflict with any other term or condition in this
agreement, the terms stated in this section will supersede such other term or condition.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.1 No Prejudice; European Economic Area Provisions; Australia Mandatory Notice.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.1.1 This agreement will not prejudice the statutory rights of any party, including those
dealing as consumers. For example, for consumers in New Zealand who obtain the Software for
personal, domestic, or household use (not business purposes), this agreement is subject to
the Consumer Guarantees Act.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.1.2 If Customer obtained the Software in the European Economic Area (EEA), Customer usually
resides in the EEA and Customer is a consumer (that is its use of the Software is for personal,
non-business related purposes), then Section 6 (Limited Warranty) does not apply to Customer’s
purchase and use of the Software. Instead, Adobe warrants for a period of 2 years from purchase
that the Software provides the functionalities set forth in the applicable user manual (the
“agreed upon functionalities”) when used on the Compatible Computer. Non-substantial variation
from the agreed upon functionalities will not establish any warranty rights. THIS WARRANTY
DOES NOT APPLY TO SOFTWARE THAT CUSTOMER USES ON A PRE-RELEASE, TRYOUT, STARTER, OR PRODUCT
SAMPLER BASIS, OR TO FONT SOFTWARE, OR TO THE EXTENT THE SOFTWARE FAILS TO PERFORM BECAUSE
IT HAS BEEN ALTERED BY CUSTOMER. To make a warranty claim, Customer must notify the Adobe
Customer Support Department during this 2 year period, providing details of proof of purchase
of the Software. Adobe will verify with Customer whether there is a defect in the Software
or advise Customer that the error arises because Customer has not installed the Software correctly
(in which case, Adobe shall assist Customer). If there is a defect in the Software, Customer
may request from Adobe either a refund or a repaired or replacement copy of the Software.
Customer shall only request refunds from the vendor who sold Customer the Software. Requests
must be accompanied by proof of purchase. In the event Customer’s warranty details are substantiated,
Adobe will meet Customer’s request for repaired or replacement Software, unless it is not
reasonable for Adobe to do so, in which case Adobe will provide Customer with a refund. For
warranty assistance, please contact the Adobe Customer Support Department.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
Please note that the provisions of Section 8 (Limitation of Liability) will continue to apply
to any damages claims Customer makes in respect of its use of the Software. Nonetheless, Adobe
shall be liable for direct losses that are reasonably foreseeable in the event of a breach
by Adobe of this agreement. Customer is advised to take all reasonable measures to avoid and
reduce damages, in particular by making backup copies of the Software and its computer data.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
This agreement, and in particular this Section 16.1.2, is intended to describe Customer’s
rights (including its statutory rights) in the event there should be problems with its use
of the Software. If Customer’s statutory rights are greater than this description, its statutory
rights shall apply.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.1.3 Nothing included in this agreement (including Section 4.4) shall limit any non-waivable
right to decompile the Software that Customer may enjoy under applicable law. For example,
if Customer is located in the European Union (EU), Customer may have the right upon certain
conditions specified in the applicable law to decompile the Software if it is necessary to
do so in order to achieve interoperability of the Software with another software program and
Adobe has not made such information available, under such circumstance, Customer must first
ask Adobe in writing to provide the information necessary to achieve such operability. In
addition, such decompilation may only be performed by Customer or someone else entitled to
use a copy of the Software on Customer’s behalf. Adobe has the right to impose reasonable
conditions before providing such information. Any information supplied by Adobe or obtained
by Customer, as permitted hereunder, may only be used by Customer for the purpose described
herein and may not be disclosed to any third party or used to create any software that is
substantially similar to the expression of the Software or used for any other act that infringes
the copyright of Adobe or its licensors.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.1.4 If Customer obtains the Software in Australia, then the following provision shall apply,
notwithstanding anything stated to the contrary in this agreement:</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
NOTICE TO CONSUMERS IN AUSTRALIA:</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law.
You are entitled to a replacement or refund for a major failure and for compensation for any
other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods repaired
or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure does not amount
to a major failure. Our software products also come with a 90-day limited warranty given by
Adobe Systems Software Ireland Limited, with an office at 4-6 Riverwalk, Citywest Business
Campus, Dublin 24, Ireland, as set out in the Agreement. If your products do not provide the

that you may have at law.
</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.2 Pre-release Software Additional Terms. If the Software is pre-commercial release or beta
software (“Pre-release Software”), then this section applies. The Pre-release Software does
not represent final product from Adobe, and may contain bugs, errors, and other problems that
could cause system or other failures and data loss. Adobe may never commercially release the
Pre-release Software. If Customer received the Pre-release Software pursuant to a separate
written agreement, such as the Adobe Systems Incorporated License Agreement for Pre-release
Software, then Customer’s use of the Software is also governed by such agreement. Customer
will promptly return or destroy all copies of Pre-release Software upon the earlier of Adobe’s
request or upon Adobe’s commercial release of such Software. CUSTOMER’S USE OF PRE-RELEASE
SOFTWARE IS AT ITS OWN RISK. SEE SECTIONS 6 AND 8 FOR LIMITED WARRANTY AND LIABILITY LIMITATIONS
RELATED TO PRE-RELEASE SOFTWARE.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.3 Educational Software Product. If the Software is an Educational Software Product (Software
manufactured and distributed for use only by Educational or Student Teacher End Users), Customer
is not entitled to use the Software unless Customer qualifies in its jurisdiction as an Educational
End User. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, such Educational Software Product may
only be installed and used in the country in which Customer qualifies as an Educational End
User. For Customer residing in the European Economic Area, “country” shall mean the European
Economic Area. Please visit <a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/edu_purchasing_ae">

to activate the Software, obtain an Adobe ID, consent to Additional Terms of Use, or require
a separate fee in order to access such Adobe Online Services. Adobe Online Services might
not be available in all languages or to residents of all countries and Adobe may, at any time
and for any reason, modify or discontinue the availability of any Adobe Online Service. Adobe
also reserves the right to begin charging a fee for access to or use of an Adobe Online Service
that was previously offered at no charge. As stated in Section 14, when the Software accesses
an Adobe Online Service, Customer’s use of such Adobe Online Service is governed by the Adobe
Privacy Policy (<a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_ae">http://www.adobe.com/go/privacy_ae</a>),
by the Adobe.com Terms of Use (<a target="ADB-ESG" href="http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_ae">http://www.adobe.com/go/terms_ae</a>),
and by any Additional Terms of Use that might be presented to Customer at that time.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">
16.4.2 Provided by Third Parties. The Software may facilitate Customer’s access to websites
maintained by third parties offering goods, information, software, and services (“Third-Party
Online Services”). Customer’s access to and use of any Third-Party Online Service is governed
by the terms, conditions, disclaimers, and notices found on such site or otherwise associated
with such Third-Party Online Services. Adobe does not control, endorse, or accept responsibility
for such Third-Party Online Services. Any dealings between Customer and any third party in
connection with a Third-Party Online Service are solely between Customer and such third party.

<br>
<p class="c5">
16.8.1.1 “Deploy” means to deliver or otherwise make available, directly or indirectly, by
any means including but not limited to a network or Internet, an Extended Document to one
or more recipients.</p>
<br>
<p class="c5">

or distribute the Key for any purpose.</p>

<p class="c5">
16.8.3 For any unique Extended Document, Customer may only (a) Deploy that Extended Document
to an unlimited number of recipients, but Customer shall not extract data from more than five
hundred (500) instances of such Extended Document (or any hardcopy representation of that
Extended Document) that contains data from a recipient; or (b) Deploy an Extended Document
to no more than five hundred (500) recipients without limits on the number of times Customer
may extract data from a recipient from that Extended Document. Obtaining additional licenses
to use Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, or Adobe Acrobat Suite shall not increase the foregoing
limits (that is, the foregoing limits are the aggregate total limits regardless of how many
additional licenses to use Acrobat Standard, Acrobat Pro, or Adobe Acrobat Suite the Customer
may have obtained). For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer purchases another Adobe product
or service that allows Customer to send a greater number of PDF files or forms (e.g. Adobe
FormsCentral or Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions), then the terms of that Adobe product or
service shall supersede the terms of this Section 16.8.3.</p>

integrated portion of a developer application that is created using the Software, including
the utilities provided with the Software, for example as part of an application that is packaged

File or developer application on a non-PC device may require Customer to obtain certain licenses
which may be subject to additional royalties, such as those set forth in Sections 16.14 and
16.15. It is solely Customer’s responsibility to obtain such licenses and pay such royalties;
