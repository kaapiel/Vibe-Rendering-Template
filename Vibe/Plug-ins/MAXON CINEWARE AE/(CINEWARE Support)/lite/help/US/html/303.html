<p>The online reference documentation (<span class="command">Help</span>) was not found. This may be due to one of the following reasons:</p>
<p><a id="hl_1" name="hl_1"></a><!--INDEX "3","Help has not been installed","hl_1"--><p><span class="HL_1">Help has not been installed</span></p>
<p>The Help System can be installed in one of two ways:</p>
<p><ol><br><li> <b>Online Update</B><br>First, make sure the language in which the Help System should be installed is already available.<ul><br><li> Call up <nobr><span class="menu">Help | Check for Updates</span></nobr> from the CINEMA 4D main menu<br><li> Look in the list that appears if the corresponding option is available. If not, switch to the "Optional" tab to see if the Help file you need is available there.<br><li> If the file is available, enable/check the file and continue with the installation.<br><li> If the option is not available, the Help System is not yet available in the desired language. Continue to check for updates in the future.<br></ul><br><li> <b>Manual Update</b><br>In order to update the Help System manually you must have the c4dupdate file that corresponds to your version of CINEMA 4D saved locally or on a medium that can be accessed locally/offline (e.g., installation DVD, downloaded file).<br><ul><br><li> Start CINEMA 4D and call up <nobr><span class="menu">Help | Manual Installation</span></nobr> from the main menu.<br><li> In the selection window that appears, select the c4dupdate file and click on "Open".<br><li> All subsequent steps reflect those of the online update option.<br></ul></ol><p></p>
<p><p><div class="hint"><span class="HL_hint">Note<br></span>If the Help files is not available in your language, it will automatically default to the English-language system. Make sure the English-language Help system is installed!</div></p>
<p><a id="hl_2" name="hl_2"></a><!--INDEX "3","The wrong path has been selected","hl_2"--><p><span class="HL_1">The wrong path has been selected</span></p>
<p>The path to the help files can be defined in the <span class="command">Local Help Path</span> field, located in the CINEMA 4D preferences menu (main menu: Edit / Preferences / Files / Local Help Path).</p>
<p>Normally there should be no path defined in this field. However, once a path is entered, CINEMA 4D will use this path when accessing the help files.</p>
<p>If the help files are not located at their default location and no path is defined in the preferences menu, no help files will be opened. So make sure the <span class="command">Local Help Path</span> field is empty or contains the appropriate path.</p>
